# but why?

sometimes your oshi’s friend announces they’re collabing in 20 hours on thier channel and your oshi forgets to post and every social media and chat server you’re on sends notifications but you get them after the stream starts because the service is late…

and then you’re like, “but this was literally on holodex 20 hours early, if i just had notifications, i wouldn’t have been late to the stream…”

# download
[releases on GitHub](https://github.com/Ayrlin-Renata/holodex-notifier/releases)

# but what does it actually do?

every like 10 minutes or so, holodex-notifier asks holodex about all your oshis’ new content, writes it down, and figures out if there’s anything new since last time. everything else is just obsessive feature creep.

you do need a holodex account so you can get an API key tho.

# it broke…

~~deal with it~~ 

i’ve included a button to share logs and also my socials and email, so feel free to just drop the logs in my inbox with a quick description of the issue

…or you could submit an issue on github, if you feel like it.

# platforms

Holodex Notifier is intended to be multiplatform, but is only available on Android via sideloading for now. if there's demand for it, i intend to put it on the Play store and potentially the App store.
